Version 1.0 - 7/26/2011

WookWook is a web-based (primarily php at the time of this writing) video game server community management system. We have used this for about 6 months now and consider it to be quite stable. It features several things:

1) The ability to kick other players to make room for ones self (i.e. "lolocaust")
2) A web-based interface to register ones self to protect against being lolocausted (i.e. "VIP")
3) A web-based interface to register custom kick messages

The EC2 folder is files hosted on a free Amazon.com EC2 instance simply because our web host doesn't allow us to execute python code from a php script. You should be able to run the majority of this code from a single directory/machine if you so desire. Additionally; keeping the code in seperate folders helps obfuscate the "dangerous" scripts from being abused by malicious users.

Current code is custom-tailored for use with Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Version 2.0 will include support for multiple servers. Version 2.5 will include support for Battlefield 3 starting in October.
